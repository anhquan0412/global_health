Repository for web-based collaborative database of the Houston Global Health Collaborative. This project is built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL and JavaScript

As people deeply involved in global health projects ourselves, we understand the importance and occasional difficulty of finding the right collaborating partner for whatever your global health issues are.

We have designed this website to easily allow you — an individual, organization, or institution — the chance to post and find opportunities related to a variety of global health topics and geographic areas.
